## Description

### Effective observability of composable DXP's using OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry (OTel) is an open-source, [CNCF backed](https://www.cncf.io/projects/opentelemetry/), cross-platform, vendor-neutral framework and specification for making systems observable. It achieves this by instrumenting code to emit traces, metrics, and logs in a standardized format, which can then be sent to an observability backend.

Here we use the [ASP.NET Aspire Dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/standalone?tabs=bash) as it is a simple OTel collector and UI that is easy to run locally. Alternatives could be full-fledged platforms such as SigNoz, New Relic, DataDog, Azure App Insights etc. which all supports ingesting OTel data.

    - Traces (calls to XM Cloud GraphQL endpoint, calls to the ASP.NET Core API)
    - Metrics
1. ASP.NET Core API (uses OTel .NET SDK)
    - Traces (HTTP calls to external API's, calls to Solr)
    - Metrics
    - Logs
