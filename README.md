## Description

### Effective observability of composable DXP's using OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry (OTel) is an open-source, [CNCF backed](https://www.cncf.io/projects/opentelemetry/), cross-platform, vendor-neutral framework and specification for making systems observable. It achieves this by instrumenting code to emit traces, metrics, and logs in a standardized format, which can then be sent to an observability backend.

In this case the [ASP.NET Aspire Dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/standalone?tabs=bash) as used as it is a simple OTel collector and UI that is easy to run locally. Alternatives could be SigNoz, New Relic, DataDog, Azure App Insights etc. which all supports ingesting OTel data.

The demo architecture:

````text

client -> traefik - next.js -> asp.net api -> solr

````


What parts of the stack do we instrument in this submission?

1. Traefik
    - Traces
    - Metrics
    - Logs
1. Next.js/JSS
    - Traces
    - Metrics
1. ASP.NET Core API
    - Traces
    - Metrics
    - Logs
1. Solr
    - Traces
    - Metrics
    - Logs
